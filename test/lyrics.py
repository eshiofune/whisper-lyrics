I let it fall, my heart And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say They were never true, never true
And the games you play You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name Your name
When I lay with you I could stay there Close my eyes Feel you here
forever You and me together, nothing gets better
'Cause there's a side to you That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name Your name
I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died 'Cause I knew that that was The last time, the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name Your name
I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died 'Cause I knew that that was the last time The last time
